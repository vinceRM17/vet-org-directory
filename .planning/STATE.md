## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Kentucky-first enrichment: Active Heroes is KY-based; smaller subset validates approach before 80K full run
- Fix existing extractors before adding new data: Broken NODC means missing data; fix foundations first
- API key signup as explicit phase: Deferred to v2 (Charity Navigator and VA Facilities integrations moved out of scope)

### Pending Todos

None yet.
